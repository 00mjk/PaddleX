# PaddleX documents

All PaddleX documents used are under this directory structure. Documents are organized by the Read the Docs method. You can view them by directly accessing [online documents] (https://paddlex.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/develop/index.html). 

## Compiling documents
Compile documents in this directory according to the following steps:

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt `
- Compile: `make html`

After the compilation is finished, the compiled document is located in the `_build` directory. Directly open `_build/html/index.html` to view the document.
